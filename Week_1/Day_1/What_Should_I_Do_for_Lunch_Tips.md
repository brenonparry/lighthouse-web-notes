### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators ( `<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code interactivly - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availibleTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminalas follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availibleTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availibleTime is", availibleTime);
}
```
